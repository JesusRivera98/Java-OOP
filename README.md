## General info
In this course we learn how to implement object-oriented programming using Java, for this we create a basic system to manage medical appointments.
In this process we learned and reinforced various concepts as well as ways to implement them in Java:

| Concept | Java | Description |
|-|-|-|
| Clase | class | They are the models on which we will build objects |
| Inheritance | extends | Classes use the values and functions of superclasses |
| Abstraction | abstract | Classes that share characteristics generalize and create a superclass |
| Object | ClassName variableName | The instance of a class |
| Encapsulation | Private, Default, Protected | Limit the scope of a variable or function |
| Polymorphism | ClassName variableName = AnotherClassName | Modify the behavior depending on the context |
| | static | Variable that ivariable that holds the value in all objects of the class|
| overload | @overwrite | change how a function works |
